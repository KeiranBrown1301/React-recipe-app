# Deliciousness!

This is an app that I wanted to build to continue to puish my react skills. 

It's very similar to something that we did during the LeWagon bootcamp but this time with recipes instead of movies. I wanted to challenged myself by using React since that is what I have been studying the most recently.

It is connected to the Spoonacular API which allows users to be able to search for a multitude of various recipes and provides a simple and easy to navigate UI.

As well as using React, I tried using the styledcomponents plugin, which I found was very non-fuss and a breeze to implement styling.
